                My journey as a front-end developer started back in 2010, working as a <span className="text-[#6e06f2]">freelancer</span> for clients all over the world for several years.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl font-medium py-3">
                After being on my own for a while, I decided to enter the corporate world, and I started working as a software developer at 
                <span className="text-[#6e06f2]"> Webflow</span> ,the same platform I was using with my freelance clients.
            </p>

            <p className="text-xl font-medium py-3">
                After some exciting months of work at Webflow, I decided to transition to <span className="text-[#6e06f2]">Stripe</span> , where I returned what I love: front-end development.
            </p>

            <p className="text-xl font-medium py-3">
                My <span className="text-[#6e06f2]"> success</span> quickly compounded I started receiving job offers from the biggest names in the industry.
            </p>

            <p className="text-xl font-medium py-3">
                All these opportunities led me to travel the world. Eventually, however, I decided to settle down for a more calm and simple routine, and I'm now working at Apple. And you know what? I love what I do! ðŸ’œ
